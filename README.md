## 📚 What This Is

This repository contains **66 comprehensive, interconnected documents** covering the complete stack of modern datacenter infrastructure, from CPU virtualization fundamentals to container orchestration and security. Unlike typical technical documentation that assumes expert knowledge, this curriculum is **structured for learning**, with clear entry points, explicit prerequisites, and progressive complexity.

### Topics Covered

- **Virtualization**: Ring-0 problem, VT-x/AMD-V, VM exits, EPT/NPT, KVM, QEMU, virtio, SR-IOV, VFIO
- **Containers**: cgroups/namespaces, runtimes (Docker, containerd, Kata, gVisor), Kubernetes orchestration
- **Container Networking**: CNI deep dive, Calico vs Cilium, eBPF, service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- **Container Security**: Image scanning/signing, runtime security, Pod Security Standards, supply chain (SBOM, SLSA)
- **Datacenter Networking**: Spine-leaf architecture, ECMP, VLAN vs VXLAN, overlay networks, BGP EVPN
- **High-Performance I/O**: RDMA (RoCEv2, InfiniBand, iWARP), PFC, DCB, NUMA considerations
- **Specialized Topics**: Firecracker/serverless, CPU/memory deep dives, compatibility layers
- **Practical Guides**: KVM development, environment setup, technology selection frameworks

### What Makes This Different

✅ **Learner-centered organization** - Not a reference manual; a structured curriculum
✅ **Explicit prerequisites** - Every document states what to read first
✅ **Multiple learning paths** - Choose by role (virtualization engineer, network engineer, etc.)
✅ **Time estimates** - Plan your learning (2 hours to 40 hours depending on path)
✅ **Progressive difficulty** - Foundational → Intermediate → Specialized
✅ **Complete coverage** - From fundamental concepts to production deployment
